<Info>
  The AFK module helps you let others know when you're away. Your status is automatically managed - just set it and go!
</Info>

The AFK system allows you to set an "Away From Keyboard" status that automatically notifies others when they mention you. When you return and send a message, your AFK status is automatically removed.

## How to Use

### Going AFK

Set yourself as AFK with an optional reason:

```bash
!afk [reason]
```

**Aliases**: You can also use `!away`

**Examples**:

```bash
!afk
!afk eating lunch
!afk studying for exams
!away watching a movie
```

The bot will confirm your AFK status:

```
🌙 YourName is now AFK
└─ reason: eating lunch
```

<Tip>
  If you're already AFK and use the command again, it will update your reason instead of removing your status!
</Tip>

### Coming Back

You don't need to do anything special! Just send any regular message in the server.

The bot will automatically:

- Remove your AFK status
- Welcome you back
- Show how long you were away

**Example**:

![Afkex Pn](/images/afkex.png)

<Note>
  The welcome back message will automatically delete after 15 seconds to keep the chat clean.
</Note>

### When Someone Mentions You

If someone mentions you while you're AFK, the bot will automatically reply to their message:

```
😴 YourName is currently AFK
└─ away for: 1 hour and 5 minutes
└─ reason: eating lunch
```

<Note>
  These notifications automatically delete after 20 seconds to avoid clutter.
</Note>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I remove my AFK status?">
    Just send any message! Your AFK status is automatically removed when you're active again.

    **Note**: Using `!afk` again won't remove your status - it will update your reason instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change my AFK reason?">
    Yes! Just use the `!afk` command again with a new reason:

    ```bash
    !afk new reason here
    ```

    The bot will confirm your reason has been updated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't want to give a reason?">
    That's perfectly fine! Just use `!afk` without any text:

    ```bash
    !afk
    ```

    Your status will be set without displaying a specific reason.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will the bot notify everyone who mentions me?">
    The bot will reply to the first person who mentions you. This prevents spam if multiple people mention you in the same message.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do the bot messages disappear?">
    To keep your server clean! Welcome back messages delete after 15 seconds, and AFK notifications delete after 20 seconds. This prevents the bot from cluttering your channels.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I see how long someone else has been AFK?">
    Yes! Just mention them in a message. The bot will reply showing how long they've been away and their reason (if they set one).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does my AFK status carry over to other servers?">
    No, AFK status is specific to each server where the bot is present. Setting AFK in one server won't affect your status in others.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips & Tricks

<Tip>
  **Short and sweet**: Keep your AFK reasons brief and clear. Examples: "brb", "eating", "class", "sleeping"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Update anytime**: Changed your plans? Just use `!afk` again with a new reason to update it.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Privacy friendly**: If you don't want to share why you're away, just use `!afk` without a reason.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Remember: Sending any message (except bot commands) will automatically remove your AFK status. Make sure you're actually back before typing!
</Warning>
